/* 
 - Hi This is the sessionHalt2.0's-ml model file.
 - Due to it's not in the production level yet, the entire solution is mocked.
 - So this file is just a placeholder for future implementation.
 - Once the ML model is ready, this file will contain the actual logic of the the ML model.
 - working POC website which demonstrates the sessionHalt2.0's-ml model can be found at: https://session-halt2-0-demo-website-bldfkl1ze-vengadeshs-projects.vercel.app/
 - This model will use ``TensorFlow.js`` for training and prediction.

 ML MODEL SOURCE CODE WILL BE HERE IN THE FUTURE
